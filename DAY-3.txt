Store for data only to get the data [it all client side in memory]

Reducer does not have data byits own

[...state] just returning new array

(1)store.dispatch ----> (2)reducer -----> (3)store ----> (4)store.getState
[How data flow]

Actions are helper 

without react-redux how things happen :
//Issue 1 
You have to call store for every component
imort store


//Issue 2
You have to call getState for every component
<Cart item={store.getStore()}/>

//Issue 4 

You have to call dispatch 


//issue 5
Issue we have to unsubscripbe by force update in componentWillUnmount
